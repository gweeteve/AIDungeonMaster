# AI Dungeon Master Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. AI-First Design
Every system component must be designed with AI agents as first-class citizens, not afterthoughts. AI agents (both DM and player characters) must have the same capabilities and interfaces as human users. The system architecture must enable seamless collaboration between human and AI participants, with clear APIs for AI decision-making, rule interpretation, and narrative generation.

### II. Universal RPG System Support
The application must be system-agnostic and support any tabletop RPG ruleset through configuration and extension mechanisms. Rules, character sheets, dice mechanics, and game logic must be modular and data-driven. No single RPG system should be hardcoded - D&D, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, etc. must all be equally supportable through rulebook imports and configuration.

### III. TypeScript-First Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All code must be written in TypeScript with strict type checking enabled. Type safety is mandatory for AI integration, complex game state management, and rule system compatibility. No JavaScript exceptions - strong typing ensures reliable AI-human interaction and prevents runtime errors in critical game moments.

### IV. Real-Time Collaborative Experience
The platform must support real-time multiplayer experiences with immediate state synchronization. All participants (human and AI) must see updates instantly. WebSocket-based communication is required for live gameplay, with automatic conflict resolution for simultaneous actions and robust offline/reconnection handling.

### V. Modern & Dynamic UI/UX
The interface must be responsive, intuitive, and visually engaging. Support for dynamic map rendering, character tokens, dice rolling animations, and immersive visual elements. The UI must adapt to different screen sizes and support both desktop and tablet experiences. Virtual tabletop elements (grids, tokens, fog of war) must be interactive and real-time.

## Technical Standards

### Architecture Requirements
- **Modular Component Design**: Every feature must be built as reusable, testable components
- **API-Driven Development**: Clear separation between frontend, backend, and AI services
- **Extensible Plugin System**: Support for community-created content, rules, and AI behaviors
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Web-based solution that works across all modern browsers
- **Scalable Infrastructure**: Design for concurrent multiplayer sessions and AI processing load

### AI Integration Standards
- **Standardized AI Interfaces**: Consistent APIs for all AI agent types (DM, NPCs, player characters)
- **Context Management**: Robust memory systems for AI agents to maintain game state and narrative continuity
- **Rule Interpretation**: AI must accurately parse and apply complex RPG rules from imported rulesets
- **Narrative Generation**: AI DM must create coherent, engaging storylines while respecting player agency
- **Fair Play Mechanisms**: AI behavior must be transparent and auditable to prevent unfair advantages

### Performance & Security
- **Sub-Second Response Times**: All user interactions must feel immediate and responsive
- **Secure State Management**: Game sessions must be protected against cheating and unauthorized access
- **Data Privacy**: User data, character information, and game sessions must be encrypted and protected
- **Offline Capability**: Core features must work offline with automatic sync when reconnected
- **Load Testing**: System must handle multiple concurrent games with AI processing

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality Gates
- **Type Safety Verification**: All TypeScript code must compile without warnings or type assertions
- **Component Testing**: Every UI component and game logic module must have comprehensive tests
- **AI Behavior Testing**: AI agents must pass scenario-based tests for rule compliance and narrative coherence
- **Integration Testing**: Full game session tests with mixed human/AI participants required
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Response time and resource usage must meet defined thresholds

### Documentation Requirements
- **API Documentation**: All interfaces between components must be fully documented
- **Rule System Documentation**: Guide for implementing new RPG systems and importing rulesets
- **AI Integration Guide**: Documentation for extending and customizing AI agent behaviors
- **User Documentation**: Comprehensive guides for game masters and players

### Deployment Standards
- **Continuous Integration**: Automated testing and deployment pipeline required
- **Environment Parity**: Development, staging, and production environments must be identical
- **Rollback Capability**: All deployments must support immediate rollback in case of issues
- **Monitoring & Alerting**: Real-time monitoring of system health, AI performance, and user experience

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices and architectural decisions. The AI-first, TypeScript-first, and universal RPG support principles are non-negotiable and must be verified in every code review and architectural decision.

All feature development must demonstrate compliance with these principles before implementation. Any proposed changes that conflict with core principles require constitutional amendment through documented review and approval process.

Technical decisions must prioritize long-term maintainability and extensibility over short-term convenience. The system must evolve to support the growing ecosystem of RPG systems and AI capabilities while maintaining stability and performance.
