# Research: Game System Management Interface

## Technology Stack Decisions

### Frontend Framework
**Decision**: Next.js 14 with App Router  
**Rationale**: 
- Provides excellent TypeScript support out of the box
- App Router enables better code organization and performance
- Built-in API routes can handle frontend-specific logic
- Strong ecosystem support for UI libraries
- Excellent developer experience with hot reloading

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Remix: Good TypeScript support but smaller ecosystem
- Vite + React: More configuration needed, less opinionated structure
- SvelteKit: Great performance but less mature TypeScript integration

### UI Component Library
**Decision**: Radix UI + shadcn/ui + Tailwind CSS  
**Rationale**:
- Radix provides unstyled, accessible components as primitives
- shadcn/ui offers pre-styled components built on Radix with excellent TypeScript support
- Tailwind enables rapid, consistent styling without CSS-in-JS overhead
- Strong accessibility features built-in
- Easy customization for RPG-themed interface

**Alternatives considered**:
- Chakra UI: Good accessibility but less customizable styling
- Material-UI: Heavy bundle size, may not fit RPG aesthetics
- Ant Design: Comprehensive but opinionated styling difficult to customize

### Backend Framework
**Decision**: NestJS with TypeScript  
**Rationale**:
- Decorator-based architecture mirrors Angular, familiar to TypeScript developers
- Built-in dependency injection and modular structure
- Excellent OpenAPI/Swagger integration for API documentation
- Strong validation and transformation capabilities with class-validator
- Built-in support for file uploads and streaming

**Alternatives considered**:
- Express + TypeScript: Requires more boilerplate and configuration
- Fastify: Great performance but less mature TypeScript ecosystem
- tRPC: Excellent type safety but more complex setup for file uploads

### Database
**Decision**: LiteDB for NoSQL document storage  
**Rationale**:
- Single-file database perfect for self-contained deployments
- Excellent .NET/TypeScript integration via Node.js bindings
- Document-based storage ideal for flexible game system schemas
- No external database server required
- Good performance for moderate concurrent users

**Alternatives considered**:
- PostgreSQL: More scalable but requires separate server setup
- MongoDB: Cloud dependency, more complex for simple deployments
- SQLite: Relational model less flexible for varying game system structures

### File Upload Strategy
**Decision**: Direct file system storage with database metadata  
**Rationale**:
- Simple deployment without cloud dependencies
- LiteDB stores metadata (filename, size, type, validation rules)
- File system stores actual document content
- Easy backup and migration
- No size limits imposed by database

**Alternatives considered**:
- Database BLOB storage: Would hit size limits with large PDFs
- Cloud storage (S3): Adds complexity and external dependencies
- Base64 encoding: Inefficient for large files

### Edit Locking Mechanism
**Decision**: Server-side locks with WebSocket notifications  
**Rationale**:
- Prevents data corruption from concurrent edits
- WebSocket provides real-time lock status updates
- Server-side enforcement ensures reliability
- Timeout mechanism prevents indefinite locks
- Clear visual indicators for users

**Alternatives considered**:
- Optimistic locking: Risk of data loss and poor user experience
- Real-time collaboration: Complex conflict resolution for this use case
- Client-side locking: Unreliable, easily bypassed

### JSON Validation Strategy
**Decision**: JSON Schema with ajv validator  
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for JSON validation
- Users can define custom schemas per game system
- Runtime validation with detailed error messages
- TypeScript type generation from schemas possible
- Extensible for future rule system complexity

**Alternatives considered**:
- Zod schemas: TypeScript-first but requires code deployment for schema changes
- Custom validation: Reinventing the wheel, maintenance burden
- No validation: Risk of invalid data breaking game sessions

## Architecture Patterns

### API Design
**Decision**: RESTful APIs with OpenAPI specification  
**Rationale**:
- Clear, predictable endpoint structure
- Standard HTTP methods for CRUD operations
- Excellent tooling support (Swagger UI, client generation)
- Easy integration with frontend and future AI agents
- File upload support via multipart/form-data

### State Management
**Decision**: React Query (TanStack Query) + Zustand  
**Rationale**:
- React Query handles server state caching and synchronization
- Zustand manages client-side UI state (modals, forms)
- TypeScript-first with excellent type inference
- Optimistic updates for better user experience
- Built-in error handling and retry mechanisms

### Error Handling
**Decision**: Centralized error handling with typed error responses  
**Rationale**:
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- TypeScript interfaces for error types
- User-friendly error messages for validation failures
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Logging integration for debugging

## Performance Considerations

### File Upload Optimization
- Chunked uploads for large PDF files
- Progress indicators for user feedback
- Client-side file type validation before upload
- Compression for text-based documents (JSON, Markdown)

### Caching Strategy
- Browser caching for static assets
- API response caching with React Query
- Image optimization with Next.js Image component
- Database query optimization with proper indexing

### Real-time Updates
- WebSocket connection for edit lock status
- Server-sent events for system update notifications
- Debounced API calls for search and filtering
- Optimistic UI updates where safe

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization
- JWT tokens for stateless authentication
- Role-based access control (future enhancement)
- Rate limiting on file upload endpoints
- Input sanitization for all user content

### File Security
- File type validation on server side
- Virus scanning for uploaded files (future enhancement)
- Secure file serving with proper headers
- Path traversal protection

### Data Validation
- Schema validation for all JSON uploads
- SQL injection prevention (N/A for LiteDB but good practice)
- XSS prevention through proper React rendering
- CSRF protection via same-site cookies
