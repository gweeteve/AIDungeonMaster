# Feature Specification: Game System Management Interface

**Feature Branch**: `001-let-users-from`  
**Created**: 2024-12-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Let users, from the web interface, create, edit, or delete a game system (D&D 5E, PF2E, Fallout, etc.).They can add JSON, PDF, or Markdown documents that contain all the info the DM and players need to play.You can create a new system by deriving it from an existing one and adding rules ‚Äî monsters, classes, backgrounds, spells, new mechanics, etc.Those documents get saved to a database so they can be used later as the system for a new session.You can set the system's name and an image to represent it. If no image is provided, a default one will be used."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input ‚úì
   ‚Üí Description provided: Game system CRUD operations with document management
2. Extract key concepts from description ‚úì
   ‚Üí Actors: Users (DMs/Players), actions: CRUD operations, data: Game systems and documents
3. For each unclear aspect: ‚úì
   ‚Üí Marked areas needing clarification for permissions and validation
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section ‚úì
   ‚Üí Clear user flow for system management identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements ‚úì
   ‚Üí All requirements testable and focused on user capabilities
6. Identify Key Entities ‚úì
   ‚Üí Game System, Document, User entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist ‚úì
   ‚Üí Some clarifications marked for permissions and constraints
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-28
- Q: For game system management, who should be allowed to edit and delete game systems? ‚Üí A: Any logged-in user can edit any game system (collaborative approach)
- Q: What should be the maximum file size limits for uploaded documents? ‚Üí A: No limits (let infrastructure handle it)
- Q: What should constitute valid JSON structure for game rules documents? ‚Üí A: User-defined validation rules per game system
- Q: When a user creates a derived game system from an existing one, how should document changes be handled? ‚Üí A: Version tracking - derived systems can sync or stay frozen
- Q: What should happen when multiple users edit the same game system simultaneously? ‚Üí A: Lock system during editing - only one editor at a time

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A Dungeon Master wants to create a custom game system for their campaign by starting with D&D 5E rules and adding homebrew content. They need to upload spell descriptions, custom monster stats, and new character classes as documents, then use this system when creating future gaming sessions.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am a logged-in user, **When** I navigate to the game systems page, **Then** I can see all existing game systems with their names and images
2. **Given** I want to create a new game system, **When** I click "Create System" and provide a name and optional image, **Then** a new empty game system is created
3. **Given** I have an existing game system, **When** I choose to derive from it and add new documents, **Then** I can create a variant system with additional content
4. **Given** I have uploaded documents to a game system, **When** I view the system details, **Then** I can see all associated JSON, PDF, and Markdown files
5. **Given** I own a game system, **When** I edit its name or replace its image, **Then** the changes are saved and reflected immediately
6. **Given** I want to remove a game system, **When** I delete it, **Then** it is removed from my systems list and cannot be selected for new sessions

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user uploads a document with invalid JSON format?
- How does the system handle very large PDF files?
- What occurs if a user tries to delete a game system currently being used in an active session?
- How does derivation work if the parent system is deleted?

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create new game systems with a custom name
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to upload an image for each game system or use a default image if none provided
- **FR-003**: System MUST support uploading JSON, PDF, and Markdown documents to game systems
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to edit game system names and images
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to delete game systems
- **FR-006**: System MUST enable creating derived game systems from existing ones
- **FR-007**: System MUST persist all game system data and documents in a database
- **FR-008**: System MUST display a list of all user's game systems with names and images
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to view all documents associated with a game system
- **FR-010**: System MUST make game systems available for selection when creating new sessions
- **FR-011**: System MUST allow users to define custom JSON validation rules for each game system and validate uploaded JSON documents against those rules
- **FR-012**: System MUST track version relationships between parent and derived game systems, allowing users to choose whether to sync changes from parent or maintain frozen versions
- **FR-013**: Any logged-in user MUST be able to edit or delete any game system (collaborative model)
- **FR-014**: System MUST allow file uploads without enforcing client-side size limits (infrastructure will handle storage constraints)
- **FR-015**: System MUST implement edit locking to prevent concurrent editing conflicts - only one user can edit a game system at a time

### Key Entities
- **Game System**: Represents a complete rule set (e.g., D&D 5E, Pathfinder), has name, image, creation date, owner, and derivation relationship
- **Document**: Individual files (JSON/PDF/Markdown) containing game rules, stats, or content, belongs to a game system
- **User**: Person who creates and manages game systems, owns systems they create
- **Session**: Gaming sessions that use a specific game system as their rule set
