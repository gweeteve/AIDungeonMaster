# Implementation Plan: Game System Management Interface

**Branch**: `001-let-users-from` | **Date**: 2024-12-28 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-let-users-from/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Web-based game system management interface allowing collaborative CRUD operations on RPG systems (D&D 5E, Pathfinder, etc.) with document upload capabilities (JSON/PDF/Markdown), system derivation features, and integration with session creation. Uses Next.js + Tailwind + Radix frontend with NestJS + LiteDB backend, full TypeScript stack.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+  
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui, NestJS, LiteDB  
**Storage**: LiteDB for game systems and document metadata, file system for document storage  
**Testing**: Jest for backend, Vitest for frontend, Playwright for E2E  
**Target Platform**: Web browsers (desktop and tablet)
**Project Type**: web - frontend + backend  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms page loads, real-time UI updates, handle large document uploads  
**Constraints**: Edit locking for concurrent access, user-defined JSON validation  
**Scale/Scope**: Multi-user collaborative editing, derived system relationships, version tracking

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

**I. AI-First Design**: ✅ PASS - Web interface designed for collaborative editing will support both human and AI users through same REST APIs. Game system management endpoints will be accessible to AI agents.

**II. Universal RPG System Support**: ✅ PASS - Feature explicitly supports multiple RPG systems (D&D 5E, Pathfinder, Fallout, etc.) with user-defined JSON validation rules per system. No hardcoded rulesets.

**III. TypeScript-First Development**: ✅ PASS - Full TypeScript stack specified (Next.js frontend, NestJS backend) with strict typing for game system entities and document validation.

**IV. Real-Time Collaborative Experience**: ⚠️ PARTIAL - Edit locking mechanism prevents true real-time collaboration but ensures data integrity. May need WebSocket implementation for lock status updates.

**V. Modern & Dynamic UI/UX**: ✅ PASS - Next.js + Tailwind + Radix + shadcn/ui provides modern, responsive interface with proper component architecture.

**Overall**: PASS with real-time collaboration consideration documented in Complexity Tracking.

**Structure Decision**: Web application with separate frontend and backend directories. Frontend uses Next.js app router structure with shadcn/ui components. Backend follows NestJS modular architecture with clear separation of models, services, and controllers.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType copilot`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Edit locking vs real-time collaboration | Prevents data corruption and conflicts in collaborative editing while maintaining data integrity | Real-time collaborative editing like Google Docs would require complex conflict resolution, operational transforms, and significantly more infrastructure complexity for a file-based document management system |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
