# Feature Specification: Homepage World Management Interface

**Feature Branch**: `002-on-the-homepage`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "On the homepage you can: See all the worlds that have already been created, each shown with its image and the session name ‚Äî click the image to launch the world. If a world has no image, the game system's image is used instead. Open the feature to manage game systems. Create a new world via a dialog where you fill in the needed info: world name, image URL to use, the game system, and a Create World button that will launch the world"

## Clarifications

### Session 2024-12-19
- Q: What validation rules apply to world names - length limits, character restrictions, uniqueness? ‚Üí A: Noms libres (1-255 caract√®res), tous caract√®res UTF-8, pas de contrainte d'unicit√©
- Q: What happens with slow-loading or broken images - show placeholder, loading state, error state? ‚Üí A: Chargement en arri√®re-plan, image syst√®me par d√©faut jusqu'√† succ√®s
- Q: How are worlds sorted - by creation date, last accessed, alphabetically, user-customizable? ‚Üí A: Par derni√®re activit√©/acc√®s (plus r√©cents en premier)

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a user, I want to access a homepage that serves as the central hub for all my AI Dungeon Master activities, where I can view all my created worlds, manage game systems, and create new worlds seamlessly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have existing worlds in the system, **When** I visit the homepage, **Then** I see all worlds displayed with their images and session names
2. **Given** I see a world on the homepage, **When** I click on the world's image, **Then** the world launches and I can start playing
3. **Given** a world has no custom image, **When** it's displayed on the homepage, **Then** the associated game system's default image is shown instead
4. **Given** I'm on the homepage, **When** I access the game systems management feature, **Then** I can manage available game systems
5. **Given** I want to create a new world, **When** I open the create world dialog, **Then** I can fill in world name, image URL, select a game system, and create the world
6. **Given** I complete the new world creation form, **When** I click "Create World", **Then** the world is created and immediately launches

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no worlds exist yet (empty state)?
- How does the system handle invalid image URLs for worlds or game systems?
- What occurs if a selected game system becomes unavailable during world creation?
- How are worlds sorted/ordered on the homepage?
- What happens if world creation fails?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display all created worlds on the homepage with their associated images and session names
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to launch a world by clicking on its image
- **FR-003**: System MUST use the game system's default image when a world has no custom image set
- **FR-004**: System MUST provide access to game systems management functionality from the homepage
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a "Create New World" dialog accessible from the homepage
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to specify world name, image URL, and game system in the creation dialog
- **FR-007**: System MUST include a "Create World" button that creates and immediately launches the new world
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate that world names are between 1-255 characters and accept all UTF-8 characters (no uniqueness constraint required)
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle image loading by showing the game system's default image immediately while loading custom images in background, replacing when successful
- **FR-010**: System MUST organize worlds by last activity/access date with most recently accessed worlds displayed first

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **World**: Represents a game session with name, custom image URL, associated game system, and session data
- **Game System**: Represents a ruleset/framework with name, default image, and configuration settings
- **Homepage**: Central interface displaying worlds collection and providing navigation to management features
